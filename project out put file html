This docment to predict the manner in which people did the exercise
1 load data and make preprocessing
###set the directory to files with pml data
setwd("E:/machine learning")
###read training and testing data
training<-read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

### preprocessing the raw data(get rid of items with too much NA or those are some irrelevant)
Ntest<-testing[mapply(function(x) sum(is.na(x))<=(length(x)/3),testing[,c(1:160)])]
#reduce the parameters in training set to the parameters that are included in testing set 
Ntrain<-training[,c(names(Ntest)[-dim(Ntest)[2]],"classe")]
# remove irrelevant items 
Ntest<-Ntest[,-c(1:5)]
Ntrain<-Ntrain[,-c(1:5)]
2 build prediction model
to improve recognition performance we used an ensemble of classifiers using the Bagging method and to estimate the accuracy in a valid way, use out=of-bag("oob") method in trControl.

4 make the prediction for testing data
apply the model to predict 20 different test cases with level of participatants' exercise
predict(modfit,Ntest)
##  [1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B
## Levels: A B C D E
According to the accuracy matrix and the OOB estimate of erro rate 0.14%, we can conclud that this predction model must work preform very well in predicting the exercise behaviors in testing data. Because the out of bag error rate is formed by applying the random forest model to the data which are not inclueded in the bagging data, that can be regarded as the out of sample error rate. The number of trees is 500, enough number of model trees to contain every variables in buiding the model.
