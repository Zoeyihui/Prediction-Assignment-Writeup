# Prediction-Assignment-Writeup
##Backgroud 
###Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect 
###a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
###These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement 
###â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
###to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.
###One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, 
###but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt,
###forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly 
###in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here:
